# September 8, 2021 Biweekly Report

For the first report, I just followed various tutorials on the tensorflow website. I only just started with machine learning this past summer, so tensorflow and deep learning in general are new to me.

I followed the CNN tutorial better than the expert quickstart tutorial because the keras API is also a bit confusing. I had fun learning neural style transfer and in general think the tutorials in the generative section are all cool. I plan to go through the rest of those and also begin exploring data on my own.
